			<p>At third level you acquire a dinosaur companion. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the attached stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. The type of dinosaur is reflected by the choice of abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent">In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, and you may choose to mix your actions with its in any order. However, while it can move and use its reaction on its own, the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>

		<description >
			<p>This two-legged lizard boasts sharp teeth and a toe claw that looks like a small sickle. It is no larger than a tall human, but looks like it could easily take down much larger prey. Used as a war mount by the halflings of the Talenta Plains, this flesh-eating dinosaur is a relative of the carver (deinonychus) and great carver (megaraptor). Clawfoot dinosaurs are usually trained for war, and even without that training, they can hold their own in combat. In the wild, they are fierce pack hunters, and even when domesticated they retain most of their predatory instincts.</p>
